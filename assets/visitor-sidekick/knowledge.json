For the best experience, lease the CenturyLink modem and count on total network compatibility and customer support.\n\n*Based on network uptime or availability\n\nSet yourself up for WiFi success >\n\nHigh-speed CenturyLink Internet\nFrequently asked questions\nExpand AllCollapse All\n\nWhat is a good download speed?\n\nAccording to the FCC, download speeds of 100 Mbps qualify as high-speed broadband, with speeds above and below that considered basic and advanced, respectively.\n\nSpeeds up to 100 Mbps support essential internet needs, like browsing, checking email, and light streaming. Speeds above 100 Mbps are best for competitive gamers, constant streamers, and anyone else “chronically online”—especially if you share the house with others or multitask with several devices.\n\nLimited availability. Service in select locations only.\n\nFCC.gov, “FCC Increases Broadband Speed Benchmark,” March 2024.\n\nShop CenturyLink Internet speeds >\n\nCan I compare my current speeds with CenturyLink speeds?\n\nYes. Use the CenturyLink speed test to see how your connection compares to CenturyLink high-speed internet plans.\n\nDo CenturyLink Internet plans have unlimited data?\n\nYes, every CenturyLink high-speed internet plan offers unlimited data so you can surf and stream whenever and for as long as you want.\n\nCan I self-install CenturyLink Internet?\n\nSometimes, depending on your CenturyLink Internet plan and location. Simply Unlimited is almost always available for self-install. Select fiber addresses may be eligible for self-install too, but most require professional installation since there’s no preexisting wiring to the larger CenturyLink network.\n\nLimited availability. Service in select locations only.\n\nIs CenturyLink Internet good for users who work from home?\n\nAbsolutely. Working from home is a breeze with high-speed internet, especially on CenturyLink Fiber’s 99.9% reliable* network. Its low latency and symmetrical upload speeds help your calls and file shares go through smoothly, while high overall speeds and unlimited data leave room for other internet users in your home, even at your busiest times.\n\n*Based on network uptime or availability\n\nWhat is the highest internet speed for CenturyLink?\n\nCenturyLink Fiber Internet offers speeds up to 940 Mbps in select areas. These speeds are ideal for households with multiple users and devices, supporting activities like streaming in 4K, online gaming, and large file downloads, all with low lag.\n\nLimited availability. Service in select locations only.\n\nIs CenturyLink 100 Mbps good?\n\nAt maximum wired speeds of 100 Mbps, CenturyLink Simply Unlimited meets the definition of high-speed broadband. In homes where Simply Unlimited speeds don’t quite reach 100 Mbps, though, this plan still provides essential bandwidth for common activities like browsing, checking email, making digital voice calls, and light streaming. \n\nSimply Unlimited is ideal for households of 1–2 people who regularly use multiple devices or households of 2–3 people who have lighter internet habits.\n\nLimited availability. Service in select locations only.\n\nFCC.gov, “FCC Increases Broadband Speed Benchmark,” March 2024.\n\nIs CenturyLink fast enough for gaming?\n\nCenturyLink Fiber Internet plans are perfect for gaming. The low ping rate (lag) makes your clicks more responsive; the ultrafast, symmetrical speeds make multiplayer interactions smoother; and the 99.9% reliable* network keeps signal drops out of your way.\n\nLimited availability. Service in select locations only.\n\nUnlike fiber plans, Simply Unlimited Internet isn’t ideal for gaming. That said, you might be able to enjoy single-player or mobile games when your network isn’t busy. Call 1-833-550-5332 today to check plan availability near you.\n\nHow does CenturyLink Fiber connect to the house?\n\nLike all wired internet services, CenturyLink Fiber connects to the house via extended cables that stretch from the larger local network directly to your home. During installation, your CenturyLink technician will lay the fiber optics right up to your home’s exterior, set up a small device called an Optical Network Terminal (ONT), then drill a new hookup where you’ll plug in your WiFi gateway.\n\nIs CenturyLink changing to fiber optic?\n\nIn many areas, yes, CenturyLink has replaced its legacy copper network with fiber-optic infrastructure for improved speeds, low lag, and overall reliability. The plan is to continue this effort throughout the country—check availability now to see if fiber has arrived in your area.\n\nIs fiber optic better than WiFi?\n\nYes and no. Fiber optics send data faster than any other internet technology, including the wireless technology we now call WiFi. However, fiber and WiFi aren’t usually competing services. Usually, WiFi just refers to the personal wireless network your modem creates by converting signals from your provider’s core network.\n\nWhen that core network is a fiber-optic one, you can expect the benefits of fiber to carry into your WiFi—including high speeds, low latency, and reliable signal fit for large households and heavy internet use.\n\nHome\n\nhigh speed internet\n\nChat now\n0\nWe use cookies to improve your experience and to support marketing efforts.

For information about taxes and fees, visit centurylink.com/feesandtaxes.\n\nAlthough our fiber service usually means 100% fiber-optic network to your location, in limited circumstances CenturyLink may need to deploy alternative technologies coupled with a non-fiber connection from a certain point (usually the curb) to your location in order to provide the advertised download speeds.\n\nCustomer speed experiences will vary, particularly when accessing the Internet wirelessly from various devices. Maximum download/upload speeds are up to 940 megabits per second via a wired connection due to overhead capacity reserved to deliver the data.
